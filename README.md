# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug I encountered with Tailwind CSS gradients. The gradient does not render as expected in the output.

## Bug Description

The gradient specified using `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500` is not applied correctly.  The background is a solid color instead of the expected gradient.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the necessary Tailwind directives are imported and correctly configured. Additional steps might include verifying Tailwind's configuration file for any potential issues.
